# Here's some lists of cool prehistoric crocodiles because I simply feel like it
## The Triassic Period
(This one is separate because PSeudosuchian biodiveristy during the triassic was pretty crazy)
- [Gracilisuchus↗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gracilisuchus), a very early small Suchian.
- [Desmatosuchus↗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desmatosuchus), an armoured herbivore reminiscent of ankylosaurus.
- [Poposauroids↗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poposauroidea), a strange family of a myriad of completely different species.
   - [Ctenosauriscus↗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ctenosauriscus), a sail-backed quadroped (and one of the oldest archosaurs)
   - [Poposaurus↗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poposaurus), a bipedal carnivore that has a couple similarities to theropods.
   - [Effigia↗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effigia), a bipedal herbivore that resembels ornithomimids in several ways.
- [Fasolasuchus↗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasolasuchus), a carnivorous land croc, and the largest pseudosuchian discovered thus far.

## The Rest of em
- [Kaprosuchus↗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaprosuchus), A crocodile with large boar-like teeth.
- [Simosuchus↗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simosuchus), an armoured herbivorous crocodile (not similar to the aetosaurs however).

- [Plesiosuchus↗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plesiosuchus), a large ocean going crocodile that shares many similarities with mosasaurs.
- [Purussaurus↗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purussaurus), the largest caiman and perhaps the largest semi-aquatic crocodillian, and the **heaviest animal** of the Cenozoic era excluding aquatic animals.
- [Boverisuchus↗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boverisuchus), a cenozoic era land croc adapted for running surprisingly fast.
- [Barinasuchus↗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barinasuchus), a massive cenozoic land croc that is the heaviest of all land predators (including mammalian ones).
