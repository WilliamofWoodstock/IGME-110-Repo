## More randomness
Here's a random link to [RIT](https://www.rit.edu/). Except I like links that makes new tabs so here's the actual <a href="https://www.rit.edu/" target="_blank">RIT!</a> (except GitHub doesn't like it)
- Normally these repos are used for storing actual code so I'm curious to see what will eventually go here
- I like drawing, gaming, writing, listening to music, and researching
- DINO RUN 2 IS COMING OUT SOON YAYAYAYAY
